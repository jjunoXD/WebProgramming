      <h2>1. My Identity & Values</h2>
      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
          I strive to create positive change in society through technology. I
          was originally interested in psychological counseling, but I realized
          I wanted to help more people in more practical ways. During the
          COVID-19 pandemic, I was inspired by the university student who built
          "Corona Map," and it made me realize that I, too, could contribute
          through technology. That’s when I decided to major in computer
          science. Now, I am pursuing that vision through the field of XR.
          Rather than simply focusing on implementing new technology, I always
          ask what kind of experience this technology can provide people, and
          what problems it can solve. I believe technology must ultimately serve
          humanity.

      <h2>2. My Philosophy in Research & Development</h2>
      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
          I have a strong orientation toward socially contributive research. I
          constantly ask myself, "What does this technology mean to society?"
          when working on any development. One example is my project using XR to
          address real-world issues such as locating missing persons and helping
          the socially vulnerable. I view technology not as a goal, but as a
          means to solve meaningful problems — problems that are grounded in
          real people and real experiences.

      <h2>3. My Journey & Turning Points</h2>
      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
          At first, I studied web and app development inspired by the Corona Map
          example, but I didn’t find it very engaging. That changed when I
          encountered XR. My interest in technology skyrocketed, and I naturally
          expanded into AI, computer graphics, and computer vision. While
          working on the missing person detection project using XR, I became
          convinced that technology could directly solve real social issues.
          Along the way, I explored various frameworks and tools, which made the
          experience even more exciting. This project became a major turning
          point in my studies and helped shape my future direction.

      <h2>4. The Future I Envision</h2>
      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>
          I want to pursue research that blends technology with philosophy. More
          specifically, I’m interested in AI-based interaction systems using XR,
          optimizing human-technology interactions through UI/UX, and
          researching technology for solving real-world problems. In the long
          term, I aim to become a researcher who bridges theory and practice —
          someone who makes a real impact on society. I hope XR evolves beyond
          immersive experiences and becomes a tool that offers new, innovative
          solutions to social challenges.

        I hope that someday, you and I will walk in the same direction —
        thinking, exploring, and researching together.
